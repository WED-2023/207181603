      This is my grandpa, Semion Shochat! He's the best! He was born and raised in a tiny village in the hills, where
      Ukraine is now. He's always been strong and never gives up.
    </p>

      Grandpa has done many things in his life. He loves his family very much. He also loves to grow plants in his
      garden. He's really good at making things out of wood, and he loves telling stories.
    </p>
    <p>
      He likes lots of different things, just like a famous painter, Leonardo da Vinci! Grandpa reads books, and he's
      learned how to make beautiful things from wood. He's very smart and always wants to learn new things. He's like a
      big bucket full of wisdom, and he's always happy to share it with people who want to listen.
    </p>

      The best thing about Grandpa is how he makes people feel good. He's super kind and always willing to help, even if
      it's not with money or things. He's made many people happy with his nice words, his smile, and his support.
      Everyone who knows him loves him very much.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I think about everything Grandpa has done in his life, I feel so thankful and proud. He's more than just a
      man; he's a light that shows us hope, someone who inspires us, and a reminder of how strong people can be. I'll
      always be grateful for him.
